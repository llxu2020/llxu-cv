Xu is a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Computer Science and Technology under the supervision of Prof. [Yinlong Xu](https://cs.ustc.edu.cn/2010/0614/c3050a23892/page.htm)  and associate Prof. [Min Lyu](https://cs.ustc.edu.cn/2019/0916/c3049a391445/page.htm) at University of Science and Technology of China. 

He is interested in distributed storage systems, data recovery and erasure coding, e.g. designing effective data layouts, efficient failure recovery algorithms, and practical erasure code schemes, and further implementing them in distributed storage systems. 

He has published several papers in top conferences and journals of storage systems, including INFOCOM, IPDPS, USENIX HotStorage, TIT and TPDS.
